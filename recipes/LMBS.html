        <h1>LMBS, the Eternal bread</h1>

        <img src="../images/cracker.png" alt="A thin, dry, unleavened bread. A true test of the guts.">

        <p>Remember to always soak it, even cook it a second time if you can. As it is not tasty, even cambium will flavor it. </p>
        <p>Remember to eat fibers with it, as it is not you gut's favourite.</p>

        <h2>The ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>Two cups of flour</li>
            <li>Half a thumb of salt</li>
            <li>Three quarters of a cup of water</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix the flour, water and salt.</li>
            <li>Once it does not stick to your fingers anymore, it should be good.</li>
            <li>spread it and cut it in parts. Pierce it of holes, so it does not rise in the oven</li>
            <li>cook them for 30 minutes, flip them and 30 minutes again.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, wrap them.</li>

        </ol>
